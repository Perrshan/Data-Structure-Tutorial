# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structure Tutorial. Knowing about different data structures can help programmers have a broader understanding of tools they can use to solve problems as well as using the best and most efficient tools for each of their tasks. Here are some of the data structures that should be in every programmer's tool belt:

- [Stack](stack.md)
- [Linked Lists](linked_list.md)
- [Trees](tree.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
